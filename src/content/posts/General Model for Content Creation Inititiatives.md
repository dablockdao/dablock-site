## Types of CCIs
Before continuing with the report, it is necessary to introduce the different types of CCIs (Content Creation Initiatives) that have been defined so far, along with some active proposals that could serve as early examples of each category.

1. **Project-focused (CCI-A)**
The **CCI-A** initiatives cover more general activities and practices typically associated with ambassador programs, such as:
- Translation of documentation and official publications of the project.
- Dubbing and subtitling of official content.

These initiatives often include varied tasks such as:
- Moderation of regional Telegram/Discord groups.
- Duplication of the project's activity on social networks.
- News dissemination, etc.

#### Examples of current CCIs in this category:
- **Bounty in Spanish (Kusama)**
- **Portuguese Content Guild**

2. **Focused on Creators and Original Content (CCI-B)**
The **CCI-B** initiatives aim to reward and support users who create original content about the ecosystem. These initiatives can be implemented in various ways, often involving milestones for creators and teams to meet while receiving support.

#### Characteristics:
- A simple way to distribute tips among regular creators.
- Can serve as a school or dojo for content creators, offering advice and feedback to improve their work and consolidate their roles in the ecosystem.

#### Examples of current CCIs in this category:
- **Paraverse Content Creators**
- **NFT Content Creation Guild**
- **Creadores Web3 (Web3 Creators)**

3. **Independents (CCI-C)**
This category includes proposals aimed at financing the activity of a single project. The goal is to enable individual creators or teams with extensive experience in the ecosystem to scale their work and responsibilities. These creators typically work independently, responding directly to token holders rather than open community initiatives.

#### Examples of current CCIs in this category:
- **The Kusamarian (original content)**
- **Cryptonitas (original content)**
- **Polkadot en Español (dubs)**

## The Need for Formal Categorization of CCIs
To optimize the work of CCIs and establish clear expectations for results, it is crucial to formalize their categorization. A common mistake is attempting to make each initiative (especially language guilds) cover a wide range of activities and topics. This approach negatively impacts original content creators and, consequently, the ecosystem. 

### Goals for Redefining CCIs:
1. Achieve greater efficiency in application.
2. Avoid overburdening initiatives with unrelated tasks.
3. Optimize results by aligning CCIs with their specific focus areas.

## Redefining Content Creation Proposals Based on the General Model
It is necessary to continue optimizing and redefining early content creation models to achieve scalable results and objectives. Instead of focusing on relatively minor aspects like treasury management models, greater creativity is needed in the fundamental application of CCIs.

### Suggestions for Improvement:
- Move away from the “reward X piece of content” approach.
- Focus on enhancing the roles of creators in the ecosystem through game mechanics and other innovative methods.

## Addressing Common Issues in Content Creation
From the early reward criteria established in the Polkadot and Kusama governance systems (e.g., tips model), several bad practices have emerged among ecosystem creators:

### Examples of Bad Practices:
1. Dubbing or subtitling videos for unofficial or local hubs' YouTube channels.
2. Translating content without proper context for unofficial or local hubs' blogs.
3. Overproduction of irrelevant content, such as interviews or news compilations.

These practices result in **unoriginal, repetitive, and uncompetitive content**, hindering the growth of platforms like YouTube channels or blogs.

## Differentiation for Optimization
To address these issues, it is essential to make a clear distinction between:
- **CCIs focused on projects (CCI-A)**.
- **CCIs focused on creators (CCI-B and CCI-C)**.

This differentiation will:
- Optimize their application.
- Clarify the expected results from each type of initiative.

By doing so, the ecosystem can foster more meaningful and impactful content creation initiatives.
