DablockDAO is an open collective of creators and contributors within the Polkadot ecosystem. Its structure is built around individuals collaborating on impactful initiatives such as **[PolkadotEcosystem.com](https://polkadotecosystem.com/)**, as well as independent efforts that enrich the broader ecosystem through content, data, and creativity.

The DAO operates on a tiered ranking system to ensure effective governance, reward contributions, and provide growth opportunities for its members.
